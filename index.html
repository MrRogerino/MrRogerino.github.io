	<h1>The Golden Age of Shooting Guards</h1>

	<h4>Foreword</h4>

	<p>Any discussion about the art of shooting your shot must include an homage to one Michael Jeffrey Jordan. The greatest player to ever grace the hardwood, MJ prototyped the next generation of "shoot-first, ask questions later" shooting guards. Gifted with supreme athleticism and an unmatched ability to get to any spot on the court, Jordan popularized and glorified the 'isolation' style that would inspire the next decade of basketball stars. </p>

	<h2>Shoot Your Shot</h2>
	<p>If you were to ask a random person on the street what a "shooting guard" does in basketball, a likely response would be along the lines of "well, they shoot!" Although a bit reductionist, the overall sentiment holds true. Almost immediately following Jordan's sixth championship and retirement in 1998 (Michael Jordan never played for the Wizards #alternativefacts), a new crop of young, brash, and offensive-minded stars vied for the title of "the next MJ." Thus, the golden age of the shooting guard was born. </p>

	<h4>Kobe Bryant</h4>

	<p>Perhaps no one came closer to Michael than Kobe Bryant. Drafted in 1996 along with Allen Iverson, Bryant immediately invited comparisons to his idol. The similarities were obvious: both stood 6'6", were athletic freaks, and possessed indomitable wills to win. In fact, Kobe modeled his game so closely to Michael that at times, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnB9bvud6IU">virtually impossible</a> to tell them apart. And after Bryant won three championships in three years (with Michael's old coach, no less), the comparisons only heated up. However, after the departure of teammate Shaquille O'Neal in 2004, Kobe's teams wallowed in mediocrity. Without another dominant star besides him, Kobe <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hyjyexj9ECU/hqdefault.jpg">epitomized the characteristics</a> of the shooting guard era: taking the ball on almost every offensive possession, and shooting difficult and terrible shots (occasionally making them). After winning another two championships in 2008 and 2010 for a total of 5 'chips (in 7 attempts), Kobe retired in 2016 as the second best shooting guard of all-time, but perhaps the most iconic player to wear the "shooting guard" title(<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kobe+meme&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_-tKRquDSAhUV62MKHZ7UA-kQ_AUICCgB&biw=1920&bih=988">the truth lies in the memes</a>). After all, he's why every crumpled up wad of paper and errant piece of trash thrown by office workers around the country are accompanied by yells of "Kobe!" </p>

	<h4>Allen Iverson</h4>

	<p>Drafted with the number one overall pick in 1996, Allen "The Answer" Iverson was the quintessential underdog story. Standing a mighty 6 feet tall in shoes and weighing 165 pounds, Iverson was a shooting guard in a point guard's body. He was proof that height wasn't everything (although it certainly does help), attacking the rim repeatedly with reckless abandon, undaunted by the 7 foot giants eager- but ultimately unable- to stop him. Lightning quick and extremely athletic, Iverson introduced himself to the national stage by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJMi5lvQqq8">hitting the GOAT with his lethal signature crossover</a>, and it wasn't before long before ballers across the nation became obsessed with replicating the "ankle breakers" that usually accompanied an Iverson crossover. In 2001, Iverson, voted the year's MVP, carried his team into the NBA Finals, where he was given the thankless task of trying to stop a Lakers team in the midst of a threepeat. Although his Sixers team lost the series, Iverson produced his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grXws5m11SA">most iconic moment</a> on his way to handing the Lakers their only loss of the postseason that year. Off the court, Iverson personified the "shoot your shot" motto more than anyone. Iverson made no attempts to hide his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI">disdain for practice</a>, while his ever-increasing arsenal of tattoos and hip-hop inspired fashion became the symbol of "gangster" culture that forced the NBA to begin enforcing a dress code. In a time where everyone strove to "Be Like Mike," Allen Iverson found his own answers, and proved that it's about the size of fight in the dog, not the size of the dog in the fight. </p>
