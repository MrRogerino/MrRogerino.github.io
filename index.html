	<h1>The Golden Age of Shooting Guards</h1>

	<h4>Foreword</h4>
	<p>Any discussion about the art of shooting your shot must include an homage to one Michael Jeffrey Jordan. The greatest player to ever grace the hardwood, MJ prototyped the next generation of "shoot-first, ask questions later" shooting guards. Gifted with supreme athleticism and an unmatched ability to get to any spot on the court, Jordan popularized and glorified the 'isolation' style that would inspire the next decade of basketball stars. </p>

	<h2>Shoot Your Shot</h2>
	<p>If you were to ask a random person on the street what a "shooting guard" does in basketball, a likely response would be along the lines of "well, they shoot!" Although a bit reductionist, the overall sentiment holds true. Almost immediately following Jordan's sixth championship and retirement in 1998 (Michael Jordan never played for the Wizards #alternativefacts), a new crop of young, brash, and offensive-minded stars vied for the title of "the next MJ." Thus, the golden age of the shooting guard was born. </p>

	<h4>Kobe Bryant</h4>
	<p>Perhaps no one came closer to Michael than Kobe Bryant. Drafted in 1996 along with Allen Iverson, Bryant immediately invited comparisons to his idol. The similarities were obvious: both stood 6'6", were athletic freaks, and possessed indomitable wills to win. In fact, Kobe modeled his game so closely to Michael that at times, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnB9bvud6IU">virtually impossible</a> to tell them apart. And after Bryant won three championships in three years (with Michael's old coach, no less), the comparisons only heated up. However, after the departure of teammate Shaquille O'Neal in 2004, Kobe's teams wallowed in mediocrity. Without another dominant star besides him, Kobe <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hyjyexj9ECU/hqdefault.jpg">epitomized the characteristics</a> of the shooting guard era: taking the ball on almost every offensive possession, and shooting difficult and terrible shots (occasionally making them). After winning another two championships in 2008 and 2010 for a total of 5 'chips (in 7 attempts), Kobe retired in 2016 as the second best shooting guard of all-time, but perhaps the most iconic player to wear the "shooting guard" title(<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kobe+meme&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_-tKRquDSAhUV62MKHZ7UA-kQ_AUICCgB&biw=1920&bih=988">the truth lies in the memes</a>). After all, he's why every crumpled up wad of paper and errant piece of trash thrown by office workers around the country are accompanied by yells of "Kobe!" </p>
